Abstract:
	Tracking the health of a person and proper medication improves their lifetime. Studies suggest that most of the deaths of senior citizens occur during the night 
  when the person is asleep. Sometimes elderly people forget to take their medicine at the correct time. They also forget which medicine they should take at that 
  particular time. And it is difficult for doctors/caretakers to monitor the patients around the clock.  This work proposes a personal assistant for the elderly or 
  a patient. Personal assistants can provide in-home respite care, allowing family members or caretakers to take a temporary break. 
  One such personal assistant is our medicine reminder system. An application is built for the user (caretaker) that enables him to set the desired time and medicine. 
  These details will be stored in the IBM Cloudant DB. When the medicine time arrives, the web application will send the medicine name to the IoT Device through the IBM 
  IoT platform. The device will receive the medicine name and notify the user with voice commands. It also has added features for better usage and added benefits. 
  It can also provide information on the medicines that the user is taking.
